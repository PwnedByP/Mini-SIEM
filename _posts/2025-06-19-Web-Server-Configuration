Now it's time to set up our web server.

For this we will download an Ubuntu Server and set it up in a different subnet, an we will install the famous Juice Shop from OWASP in it which is a website with many known vulnerabilities in it so we can further practice our attacks and defenses.

I'll not cover here how to install the Ubuntu Server, once we have it in a VM we will the proceed to install what we need for the website.

First we will head to the documentation:

[Juice Shop]https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop

Here we can find that we need to install node.js first, to install it we will use apt:

If we want to make sure it's installed we can use:

```node-v```
